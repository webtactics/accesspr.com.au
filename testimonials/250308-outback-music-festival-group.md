“Kylie's and Access’ understanding of the media landscape and their many strong and trusted relationships with key media enable them to generate huge and diverse coverage of our festivals. 

They never fail to attract a significant contingent of hosted and accredited media to our festivals, often totalling over 50 media personnel. 

Kylie is creative, diligent, hardworking, trustworthy and results-focused and always puts her clients’ needs first. 

I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Kylie and her team to any organisation.”
