The Access team has managed PR for Outback Music Festival Group since 2019, driving awareness and attendance to two of Australia’s biggest annual outback events – the Birdsville Big Red Bash and the Broken Hill Mundi Mundi Bash. 

We lead all aspects of PR for both festivals, from major announcements and media relations to VNR/image production, media famils, live crosses, and on-site press office operations. Our strategy also leverages profiling of the festivals’ founder, Greg Donovan, which has resulted in long-form features on Australian Story, Sunday Night, The Project, 7.30 Report, The Australian Women’s Weekly and Radio National, to name just a few. 

We also manage interviews and artist liaison for the festivals’ music lineups, which have featured Australian legends such as Midnight Oil, Jimmy Barnes, Missy Higgins, Kasey Chambers, Paul Kelly, and many more.

In addition, we manage the festivals’ high-impact PR stunts – from breaking the World Record for the Largest Nutbush Dance to creating the World’s Biggest Map in support of Big Blue Day. These visually striking and culturally relevant stunts generate thousands of hits across TV, radio, print, online and social – driving mass awareness and ticket sales, and elevating the festivals from music events into unmissable destination experiences.
