Access partnered with The Star Sydney for five years, serving as their retained PR agency and winning two competitive pitches along the way. 

Our key objective was to position The Star as a distinct, must-visit Sydney destination and to drive visitation to its restaurants, entertainment and retail precincts. We managed an always-on press office, media and influencer famils, VIP and celebrity engagement, and ad hoc projects across lifestyle, dining, retail, events, and community relations.

Initially, we were engaged to raise the profile of Sokyo, The Star’s signature Japanese restaurant, and its executive chef, Chase Kojima. Through strategic PR and media relations, we repositioned Sokyo as one of Australia’s top Japanese dining experiences, generating hundreds of top-tier stories, including cover features in The Daily Telegraph - Taste and front-page coverage in The Sydney Morning Herald.

Following this success, our remit grew to cover The Star’s full portfolio of signature venues, including Sky Terrace and Momofuku Seiōbo, as well as PR for major partnerships including Sydney Festival, Vivid Sydney, and the Sydney Swans.

We managed a year-round calendar of media and influencer famils, and publicised seasonal campaigns for Valentine’s Day, Lunar New Year, Mardi Gras, Mother’s Day and more. Additionally, we delivered media training, award submissions and business events PR, ensuring The Star’s reputation shone across every touchpoint.
