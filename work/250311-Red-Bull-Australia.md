Access worked closely with Red Bull Australia for three years, managing national profiling and media tours for their roster of sponsored athletes including Olympian Courtney Atkinson, FMX and Nitro Circus star Josh Sheehan, big-wave icon Ross Clarke-Jones, and World Champion surfer Carissa Moore.

One of our standout early projects was managing Josh Sheehan's national media tour ahead of his history-making Moto X double backflip at the X Games. Our efforts secured widespread coverage, including nationally syndicated full-page News Corp features, interviews on The Today Show and Sunrise, a major Sun Herald feature, and more.

Building on this success, Red Bull engaged Access to manage PR for additional athletes and to launch the inaugural Red Bull Dune Dusters event. Across all these projects, we delivered top-tier media coverage, from live interviews  on breakfast TV shows to on-site surf event coverage, and regular appearances on Fox Sports and Wide World of Sports.

Access also secured regular columns in News Corp titles such as the Sunday Telegraph and Gold Coast Bulletin, ghost writing editorials for Red Bullâ€™s athletes and raising their profiles nationally.
