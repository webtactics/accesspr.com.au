Access was first engaged by Northern Territory Major Events (NTMEC) in 2016 to manage PR for the internationally acclaimed Aboriginal light festival, Parrtjima – A Festival in Light.

Since then, our partnership has grown and we are now NTMEC’s agency of record, handling year-round PR for their corporate brand and consumer publicity across their major events portfolio, which includes Parrtjima, BASSINTHEGRASS music festival, Million Dollar Fish, Betr Darwin Triple Crown, Red CentreNATS, MXGP of Australia, and more.

We manage end-to-end event publicity including strategy, major announcements, media relations, issues management, talent liaison, media famils, on-site press offices, PR stunts and activations.  

We conceived and launched Parrtjima’s first interstate activation at Melbourne’s Federation Square and managed the national announcement of the first-ever Million Dollar Fish winner – a story that dominated headlines across Australia and internationally in 2024.

Much of our work with NTMEC involves working closely with Aboriginal cultures, communities, creatives, and talent. We bring not just respect, but a deep cultural awareness, understanding, and appreciation to every project we undertake.
