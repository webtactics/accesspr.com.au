Access PR is proud to have partnered with the NSW Government’s Barangaroo Delivery Authority for three years launching, positioning and driving visitation to Sydney’s newest harbour foreshore park, Barangaroo Reserve.

The park is highly significant for the Indigenous communities of Sydney and surrounds, and is part of the city’s biggest CBD transformation. Our multifaceted PR campaigns and stakeholder engagement work celebrated cultures, community connections and the stories that make Barangaroo truly unique.

We managed an always-on press office,and numerous projects, campaigns and major events spanning Aboriginal cultures and education, general entertainment, ceremonies, New Year’s Eve parties, Aboriginal art projects, contemporary art and culture events, the BLAK Markets, NAIDOC Week and more.

Collaboration was key, as we engaged with NSW Government departments, including Destination NSW and the Premier’s Office, as well as a host of high-profile stakeholders and communities to ensure seamless communication and engagement throughout.
