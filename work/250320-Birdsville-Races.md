When we were first engaged, the Birdsville Races received around 100 media stories annually, with no formal PR program in place.

The Access team have expertly managed PR for iconic outback Queensland event, the Birdsville Races, since 2016.

When we were first engaged, the Birdsville Races received around 100 media stories annually, with no formal PR program in place. Fast forward almost a decade, and the races now attract around 7,000 attendees each September and generate thousands of pieces of coverage across national and international media.

Our team has been pivotal in building the event's PR infrastructure from the ground up, executing PR annually from a long-lead stage and working closely with organisers to leverage hero talent, quirky stories and solutions to enable media coverage from a highly remote event. 

This included setting up a press office from the racetrack using state-of-the-art satellite technology, which has enabled us to facilitate live broadcasts with the likes of Sunrise, The Today Show, ABC News Breakfast, The Project, 7.30 Report and more, as well as blanket coverage across national TV news and radio.

We also manage the event’s media photography, video news releases, visiting media, and major announcements such as the Birdsville Cup winner immediately following the big race. 

Every year, our efforts deliver massive national media coverage across broadcast, print and online, solidifying the Birdsville Races as one of Australia’s most iconic bucket-list destination experiences.
