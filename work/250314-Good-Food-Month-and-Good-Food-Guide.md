For a collective seven years before Nine took PR in-house, the Access team managed publicity for Fairfax’s flagship culinary properties: Good Food Month, the Good Food Guide, and the prestigious Good Food Guide Awards. 

Our key objective was to drive awareness and visitation to Sydney’s iconic Good Food Month, a month-long celebration of chefs, restaurants, pop-ups, masterclasses, collaborations, and exclusive events. With Destination NSW as a key partner, our efforts targeted not just locals, but interstate and international audiences. 

Beyond Good Food Month, we managed PR for the renowned Good Food Guide and its high-profile awards. Our work included the national relaunch of the Good Food Guide, alongside profiling top restaurants in every Australian state and territory. For the Good Food Guide Awards, we managed red carpet media and the national announcement of winners.

Our results were consistently outstanding, surpassing KPIs annually, and playing a key role in repositioning Good Food as Australia’s pre-eminent national brand on culinary excellence.
