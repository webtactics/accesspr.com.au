For five years, Access PR served as the consumer PR agency for the Art Gallery of New South Wales, crafting and executing publicity campaigns to drive awareness and visitation for its year-round calendar of ticketed exhibitions, events, and workshops.

During this time, we publicised a wide range of world-class exhibitions, including: Australia’s most prestigious portraiture award, The Archibald Prize; The Wynne and Sulman Prizes; the annual ARTEXPRESS; and blockbuster exhibitions like Rembrandt and the Dutch Golden Age, Pop to Popism, Art from the Tate Collection; and Treasures from the Silk Road Capital.

From strategy to execution, we managed every aspect of publicity, including major announcements, media previews, media calls, famils, and influencer engagement. 

The impact of our work was both immediate and far-reaching. We helped deliver record crowds and the highest media coverage ever achieved by an Art Gallery of New South Wales exhibition at the time. Several shows we publicised were so successful that their runs were extended to meet overwhelming demand. 

Perhaps most importantly, we helped achieve a significant strategic goal by attracting younger, non-traditional audiences, reinforcing the gallery’s place as a dynamic and inclusive cultural destination whilst helping to future-proof its appeal.
