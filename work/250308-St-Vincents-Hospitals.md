Access was the first external PR agency hired by St Vincent’s Hospitals’ central marketing team to develop a consistent publicity and social media program across all nine of their private hospitals. The brief was significant, given the organisation’s complex stakeholder mix, limited spokespeople and strict communications regulations.

We tackled these challenges with an integrated strategy focused on powerful storytelling via national broadcasters, newspapers, magazines and parenting websites. We scoped and crafted human-interest stories that resonated with audiences and placed St Vincent’s at the forefront of public conversation.

Our approach involved developing media case studies tied to key awareness days and health trends, and activating new hospital initiatives through media calls, exclusives, and impactful announcements. This ensured ongoing visibility and highlighted the hospitals' commitment to excellence and innovation.

For St Vincent’s Mater Maternity, we revitalised dormant social media channels by boosting video content, interactive community management, and user-generated content. During COVID, we launched successful webinars to meet the increased demand for education and connection.

Our strategy was highly successful, exceeding KPIs and driving monthly growth across all traditional and new media metrics.
