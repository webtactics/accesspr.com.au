For four years, Access worked with a number of Charles Darwin University’s (CDU) departments on major projects from corporate restructuring to student services, digital transformation to issues management. 

CDU is a multi-sector university with more than 21,000 students across eight campuses and centres, and it has undergone some significant changes over time, requiring a robust, consistent and agile communications approach.

Our work has included developing corporate communications audits and strategies; crisis and issues management; media relations and publicity; policy drafting; and creating and implementing major communication campaigns with the merging and demerging of the university and TAFE.

We worked closely with the Vice-Chancellor’s office, executive group, academics, researchers, HR, and the marketing, media and communications division, ensuring stakeholders at every level are supported, informed and engaged along the way.
