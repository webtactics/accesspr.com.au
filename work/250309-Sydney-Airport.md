For more than five years, Access PR provided ongoing communications, media relations, content creation, social media, and stakeholder engagement services to Sydney Airport.

During this period, we delivered year-round press office support, managing key announcements and media launches for several Australian-first, airport-first and new-to-airport brands across retail, dining, food, beverage and wellness. We also produced and managed social media content for the airport's non-corporate Facebook and Instagram pages.

To support this, we executed media calls, famils and influencer partnerships, and produced a digital content series featuring well-known airport characters such as celebrity chef Luke Mangan. 

This integrated approach not only generated widespread media coverage but also significantly boosted reach, driving organic growth and engagement across the airport’s social media channels.

Our team also delivered internal and external communications for the airport,
including developing a new Terminal Operations Manual - a crucial ‘bible’; 360-degree communications and marketing for the major infrastructure programs surrounding the terminals; and extensive airline stakeholder engagement.
