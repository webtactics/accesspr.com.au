Access is the PR partner for Australia's hottest winter arts event, Darwin Festival. We manage national and local publicity for this 18-day celebration of music, theatre, dance, comedy, and visual arts.

From strategy to execution, we drive awareness, attendance and ticket sales with impactful editorial coverage, working closely with the festival’s artistic director and key talent to secure high-value, on-message exposure across interstate and local media.

We manage major announcements, strategic pitching, media relations, launches, interviews and live broadcasts, publicising more than 180 events across more than 40 venues. In 2024, we secured features in The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Australian, The Courier-Mail, Australian Traveller, Time Out, Channel 9, ABC and more.

In our first year working with Darwin Festival, we contributed to a record-breaking attendance of 177,134 and sales of more than 55,000 tickets – marking one of the festival’s most successful editions since 1979.
