Access first began working for The Ethics Centre, a unique national not-for-profit organisation that brings ethics into everyday life, for its annual Festival of Dangerous Ideas (FODI).

Since then, we have deepened our relationship with the centre and we’re proud to deliver media relations and publicity on a number of major initiatives, from podcasts to re-launching the world’s only free ethical helpline called Ethi-Call, along with overall publicity and, of course, FODI.

We have also completed extensive media training for The Ethics Centre spokespeople whose expertise runs from AI in military warfare to the evolution of morality.
