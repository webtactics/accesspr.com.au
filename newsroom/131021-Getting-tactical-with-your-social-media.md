<p>We&rsquo;re always seeing new ways that brands are piggy backing off trending topics for their campaigns.</p>
<p>And why wouldn't they?</p>
<p>If they can make it relevant to their brand, why not get onto a trending topic?</p>
<p>Exactly. Why not?</p>
<p>Using tactical ads and posts to tap into a trending topic is a great way for brands to get involved with a conversation where they could be exposed to hundreds of thousands of people. For example, when the royal baby was announced earlier this year, Coke, Oreo and Magnum were a few of the companies who used the trending topic to create clever <a href="http://www.adnews.com.au/adnews/royal-baby-mania-but-where-are-the-local-tactical-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">images, taglines and posts.</a></p>
<p>Brands should always be on the lookout to leverage situations. In some cases they can plan ahead. This week we saw brands using the season finale of TV series <em>Breaking Bad</em> to promote their brand and opinions. With upcoming major events brands can use the time to create a strategy to make the most of the large audience, but in some instances, companies need to be creative and think on their feet to make the most of a situation.</p>
<p>Cast your mind back to the Super Bowl earlier this year which became famous for Oreo&rsquo;s tweet during the blackout - &ldquo;you can still dunk in the dark&rdquo;. Oreo was quick to identify the situation, developed a simple image, had it signed off and out to the public in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Would we remember the Super Bowl that had a blackout if it hadn&rsquo;t been for this reactive tweet? I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t. The tweet, which according to <a href="http://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/marketers-jump-super-bowl-blackout-twitter/239575/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>AdAge</em></a> was retweeted more than 10,000 times in one hour, could have been worth more than the Super Bowl TV commercial Oreo paid for!</p>
<p>Brands will gain the most out from social media and digital campaigns by being more creative and nimble. A solid social media policy for your organisation will reduce any potential risks of being quick to seize tactical opportunities. If you start looking at what&rsquo;s trending you never know what opportunities you might find.</p>
