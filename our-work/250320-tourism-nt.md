Since 2017, Access has been the PR agency of record for Tourism NT, winning the account three consecutive times. Our team manages Tourism NT’s highly successful Always-On program across Australia and New Zealand, managing everything from strategic press office to year-round media famils (familiarisation trips) and content creation.

We’ve also spearheaded large-scale integrated projects for Tourism NT, including celebrity ambassadorships with media personality Poh Ling Yeow and AFL star Daniel Rioli, as well as experiential activations such as DJ on A Bike’s takeover of Darwin’s CBD and a multisensory ‘A Night in the NT’ pop-up in Sydney, complete with tonnes of red sand from Central Australia.

Additionally, we created Tourism NT’s first-ever sustainable tourism case study kit and have brokered media partnerships with the likes of ABC Radio National, Sunrise, The Today Show, Getaway, The Australian Women’s Weekly, Travel Guides, and many more.

Our team also manages Tourism NT’s Business Events PR program, helping to promote the Northern Territory as a competitive, distinctive and meaningful place to host business events.

As a trusted extension of Tourism NT’s in-house team, we consistently exceed KPIs every year, driving significant awareness and consideration for the Northern Territory as a desirable holiday and business events destination
