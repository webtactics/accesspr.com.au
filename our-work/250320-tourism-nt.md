Access has been the retained communications agency for Tourism NT since early 2017, working across all aspects of domestic communications and PR for this remarkable destination that showcases Indigenous cultures like nowhere else in Australia.

Working closely with the in-house communications and marketing teams, we deliver always-on press office and campaign work, a robust media engagement program, and media train both Indigenous and non-Indigenous tourism operators.

Our pillars of focus include Indigenous cultures, sustainability (environmental and cultural), arts, accessibility, and wildlife and nature to name a few.

We also manage the always-on communications for NT Business Events, whose mission is to bring major corporate and incentive conferences and events to the NT.
