Mates4Mates is a national charity that actively supports veterans, Defence Force members and their families by providing social connection activities, psychological support, physical rehabilitation and skills for recovery programs.

Access worked on retainer with Mates4Mates for two years, successfully launching them in the Northern Territory. Our key objectives were to raise awareness and understanding of what the organisation offers and ensure that veterans, Defence Force members and their families are able to find the right support when and where they need it.

Covering a range of activities, we helped deliver communication strategies, stakeholder engagement plans, strong publicity and effective media relations around their services. We also provided extensive media training to executives, client liaison officers and specialists during our tenure.
