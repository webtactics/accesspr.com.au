Access launched as a start up in 2008 and since then has become one of the industry’s most respected independent communications and PR agencies. 

Much of our work focuses on helping grow understanding and awareness of Indigenous cultures, enterprises and communities. 

We have two distinct, but connected, divisions: Consumer PR and Corporate Communications. 

Our consumer publicity campaigns inspire people to go places. Whether it’s travel destinations, major events, community festivals or creative activations.  

Our corporate work helps purpose-driven organisations and government bodies through strategic communications, media relations, stakeholder engagement, reputation management, positioning and media training.
